            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

vnto the Scriptures. Thus you ſee the fathers conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned all doctrine, not confirmed by the Scriptures: And I dare boldly affirme it, that your tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers them ſelues, on whom ye repoſe you (if they be well awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked) will not ſo aduaunce the fa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thers that in them alone you ſhould repoſe the directio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of your fayth: if that be theyr meanyng, they do but decayue you, &amp; deale nothyng playnely.

They dare not ſo teache you: will they haue you with <hi>Irenaeus, Victorius, Papias, Lactan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tius, Methodius,</hi> and many other of the excellent learned fathers ſubſcribe to the hereſie of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
               <hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linaries?</hi> I know they will deny it: Will they haue you with <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtin</hi> diffinitiuely iudge all infa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tes dying without baptiſme to be da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned, &amp; that the Sacrament ſhould be miniſtred to infantes? They wil neuer alow both: Wil they haue you with Cyprian, new chriſten all ſuch heretickes, as were baptiſed out of the Churche, if afterwardes they be conuerted? They do not ſo teach
<pb facs="tcp:8358:6"/>
you: Will they haue you with Hierome condemne all ſeconde mariages, for whoredom? What ſoeuer they thincke, they dare not affirm it: Wil they haue you with Denice at the buriall of the dead, to annoynt the corſes with oyle? Them ſelues do not vſe it: Wil they haue you to follow the example of Benet, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded the Sacrament to be put into the mouthe of a dead Nunne? They will not confeſſe it. And to conclude, becauſe the Fathers many times ſay true, they abuſe theyr names, to lead you to error. Your leaders them<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſelues in ſubſtaunce of truth diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent from the Fathers, and lead you to miſchiefe, with ſome of theyr errors. You ſee howe the greateſt had faultes full of dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, which muſt nedes make you
<pb facs="tcp:8358:6"/>
feare to hange your faythe vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon them. That grounde is to ſclender for ſo weighty a cauſe, you ſee howe they erred, yee ought to be carefull, ſeing therby you haue cauſe to knowe they were but men. If you tell this to your leaders, and require at theyr handes a moe certayne ground to builde on your fayth, they will ſende you to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celles, for they can not erre: the pope is theyr warrante: becauſe they affirme it, they would haue you beleue it, but be not to haſtie to wage them w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> credite. Take theſe for exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples, that Councels may erre: The Councell of <hi>Are<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> conſented to the hereſie of the <hi>Arrians.</hi> The ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d Councell of <hi>Epheſus</hi> did leane to the here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie of the <hi>Eutychians.</hi> And the <hi>Calcedon</hi> councell woulde haue

geuen to <hi>Leo</hi> Byſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> the name of vniuerſall byſhop, if the good father (being abſente) had not vtterly refuſed it. But thys your blinde guides do hold for ſound doctrine. But no for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cel would euer ſo iudge it. The Councell where <hi>Cyprian</hi> was chiefe, did conſent to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſing of hereticks. And did not the Councell of <hi>Conſtaunce</hi> breake the inſtitution of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the bloud of Chriſt, in withholding the cup from the laitie, which no Councell before woulde haue allowed? Thus in the Councels you ſee open error, and that they alwaies teach not a conſtant truthe. But <hi>Salomon</hi> affirmeth that a true mouth is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer conſtante, but you ſee the councell not ſo: and therefore by theſe wordes of <hi>Salomon</hi> ſubiect

As here in originall ſinne, that which is as it were the matter or ſubſtaunce thereof, is the corruption which is in nature. Now for
<pb facs="tcp:8358:27"/>
aſmuch as death is the penaltie due vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſame corruption, therefore that bonde and ſubiection wherein man ſtandeth tyed vnto this penaltie, is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the giltiſhip.

The ſhamefull vntruthe whereof, is by that whiche is ſayde before, more then manifeſt: for as muche as it is there proued, that Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall ſynne is not onelye accordyng to theyir ſaying, an imputation of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams giltiſhippe, or bonde to the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naltie due to the offence: but alſo a full corruption of hys whole nature.</p>

               <p>That althoughe Adam was crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <note place="margin">The aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer.</note> after the Image of God, partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patyng hys naturall goodnes and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue as was ſhewed before, all whiche ſéede of originall righteouſnes ſhoulde by hym haue bene conueyed into hys poſteritie: yet were all thoſe excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent qualities, not ſo indiuiſibly cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent to hys nature, but that to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayning of them there was a certayne condition annexed, the breache where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſhoulde bée hys depriuation from all: namely, vnder the condition of hys <note place="margin">God c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

But here agayne the aduerſaries obiect, that <note place="margin">An other obiection.</note> as by the fall of Adam, nature receiued this foyle to the infection of all hys po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteritie: ſo by his iuſtification he beyng agayne made righteous, it ſhoulde fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that he ſhould conuey a iuſtified na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture into all hys poſteritie. Unto thys <note place="margin">An anſwer to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection.</note> obiection it is thus eaſily aunſwered, that in euery ſinne (as hath bene ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before) two thynges are to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, namely the acte, and the giltiſhip. Now Adams iuſtification did not for the preſent ſtate reſtore hys firſt origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall purenes, or clenſe hys nature from all her corruption: but only this it did, it aſſured him that the giltiſhip of hys corrupt nature was not imputed vnto hym, and layd to hys charge, ſo that hys iuſtification did not purge hys nature from ſinne, but it dyd frée and acquite
<pb facs="tcp:8358:29"/>
hys perſon from the giltiſhip and obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, wherein he ſtoode tyed vnto the penaltie. Wherefore Adam ſtill poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed hys corrupt nature, wherin all hys ofſpryng by hym were generate, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by all theyr natures were laden wyth the ſame infection.</p>
               <p>An other of the aduerſaries obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions is thys, that ſéeyng no acte is <note place="margin">In other obiection.</note> ſinne vnleſſe it bée willinglye done, and that chyldren in theyr infancye haue no wyll, therefore it ſhoulde fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that infantes haue no ſinne. For aunſwer whereof, it is eaſily graunted <note place="margin">The aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer.</note> that as touchyng actuall ſinne in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, of theyr owne committyng, they haue none, but touchyng originall ſinne, theyr nature therwithall remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth defiled, ſeyng theyr nature can be of no other condition, as is ſayd before, then the originall nature where of they be bred. Should not a man ſéeyng the yong whelpe of a Wolfe, or Tygre call them beaſtes of a rauenous or cruell nature, becauſe that their weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe thorough tendernes of age can not expreſſe in action thoſe properties
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:8358:29"/>
of nature. Yes ſurely, they wante but tyme and age to make them manifeſt.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe the Serpent in the harte and colde of the wynter, lyeth in hys <note place="margin">The na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Serpent.</note> ſhrowde ſo weake, that he may be tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched without daunger of hys bityng, which happeneth by want of ſtrength, and not that he ſhoulde be iudged ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to haue loſte hys venimous na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: for ſo ſoone as aunſwerable tyme furniſheth hym of ſtrengthe, hée be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrayeth the ſame. Euen ſo younge children, thoughe they haue no actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all ſynne in them of theyr owne com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittyng, whiche they call perſonall ſinne: yet are they vtterly defiled by the originall corruption of their whole nature, and want onely tyme, and age to expreſſe the fruites therof.</p>
               <p>And hereby appeareth the groſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of thys errour, in that they rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonne from <hi>A ſpecie</hi> to the generall woorde by a Negatiue, then whiche <note place="margin">A falſe ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument.</note> kynde of argumente none is falſer. For this it is, infants haue no actuall ſinne, <hi>Ergo,</hi> they haue no ſinne. And where theyr argument was grounded hereon,
<pb facs="tcp:8358:30"/>
that vnleſſe it were willingly done, it were no ſinne: thereto it may be truly anſwered, that euen this ſinne where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they are culpable, was willingly com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mitted, though not in theyr owne per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, yet in their firſt father of whoſe cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt ſéede they were bred.

How then commeth it, that from our parentes we ſhoulde receyue this cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption? The which is thus by ſome <note place="margin">The aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer.</note> learned fathers anſwered, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſoule is not by hys creation ſinfull, but foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as mans diſobedience hath vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpoyled hys whole nature of original righteouſneſſe, and foraſmuch as the ſoule is in the creation knit vnto a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſubiect vnto that loſſe, and made a part of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> accurſed man: Therfore it is forthwith both depriued of the original grace and vertue, wherwith by creatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

it was indued, and wherewith it ſhould haue gouerned the body.

And euen naturall Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy teacheth this, that betwéene the ſoule and the body, there is a certaine ſympathy or knitting of affection: for who ſeeth not that in melancholy bodyes the mynde is heauy and ſolitary, in ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guine bodies mery and lyght, &amp;c. where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it appeareth, that the mynde beyng
<pb facs="tcp:8358:31"/>
thus incloſed in thys houſe of corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is greatly blinded and drowned in the perfection thereof, and ſo caryed away vnto the delight thereof. Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye thys curious ſearche of the propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of originall ſinne, as it is very hard and difficulte, ſo it is more then vaine, and vnto ſaluation nothyng at all ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary. Wherefore the aduerſaryes ought rather in following the counſell of <hi>Saint Auguſtine,</hi> in thys matter to labour and ſtudy to finde the way howe they muſt be drawen out of the danger of this originall filth &amp; corruption, then curiouſly to ſtand queſtioning how they fell into it, he rehearſeth a pretye ſtory how a certayne man chauncyng to fall into a déepe pitte, lying there ſhouting &amp; <note place="margin">A proper &amp; mery hiſtory</note> crying, an other hearing him, came to the pitte and began very diligently to e<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Hauing thus briefly ſpoken of originall ſinne, I thinke it not conueny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent becauſe thys deuyſion is receaued, to ſpeake now of actuall ſinne, whiche in
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:8358:31"/>
déede is nothyng els but a fruite or effect <note place="margin">The defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all ſinne.</note> of the other. Wherefore it may bée thus defined, actuall ſynne is euery thought, woorde, and déede, or whatſoeuer is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the lawe and wyll of God, and what ſoeuer is not of fayth. The truth of this definition is thus gathered, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as it is already proued, that the whole nature of man is by original ſinne vtterly corrupted: Therefore the ſame ſynne triumphyng in his nature, as a cauſe continually woorkyng, can not but bring forth her effectes or fruites. And by the woordes of Chriſt, the fruite muſt bée aunſwerable to the trée, therefore all thoughtes, woordes, &amp; déedes, &amp; what ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer procedeth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that corrupt nature, is corrupt, &amp; vncleane, &amp; ſo actuall ſinne: and that thoughtes be herein co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>prehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, it is playne, for that they bée the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectes of the originall corruption. For Chriſt himſelfe ſayeth: <hi>Out of the heart goeth euill thoughtes,</hi> and if any acte beſide be not comprehended vnder theſe woordes, thought, woorde, or déede, the ſame is comprehended vnder theſe ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall wordes of Paule: <hi>whatſoeuer is
<pb facs="tcp:8358:32"/>
not of fayth is ſinne.</hi> Whereby it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth that not onely euyll thoughtes, wordes and déedes be actuall ſinne, but alſo thoſe thoughtes, wordes, &amp; déedes, which otherwiſe (morally) of their owne nature be honeſt and good, yf they bée done out of fayth, that is to ſay, if they be done by enuy, not through fayth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable vnto God in Chriſt, euen thoſe thoughtes, wordes &amp; déedes (ſéeme they neuer ſo holy) bée ſinne. Now foraſmuch as there is a deuiſion of actuall ſynne, which hath bene of long tyme receyued, it is expedient that ſomewhat bée ſayde concerning the ſame. The deuiſion is thys, into deadly ſinne, and into veniall <note place="margin">The defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all ſinne.</note> ſinne. About both which partes, not only how triflingly, but alſo how wicked<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly the ſcoolemen do holde, ſhal partly be ſhewed. Wherfore, firſt touching dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſinne in that they bynd them to a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne number, affirming onely ſeuen <note place="margin">The tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching that there is but vii. deadly ſinnes is mere papi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical &amp; falſe.</note> ſinnes to be deadly, they doe not onely geue vnto man ſecuritie, in that hys e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy hath but ſeuen wayes to aſſaulte hym vnto death, from which if hée can imagine hym free, he thinketh hymſelfe
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:8358:32"/>
in any other offence not to ſynne dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, whereby all other ſynnes are extenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate, and all wicked inclinations, affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and thoughtes, excluded from the number of deadly ſinnes. And yet ſinnes be called deadly for no other cauſe, but becauſe death is due vnto them. And therefore vnto what ſinne ſoeuer death <note place="margin">All ſinne for the which death is due is of it ſelfe deadly un Rmo. 6</note> is due, that ſinne is conſequentlye dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye, but death is due to all ſynne. For Paule ſayth generally, <hi>the rewarde of ſinne is death,</hi> and therefore all ſynne is (in reſpecte of hys owne nature) deadly. And though there bée ſynnes whyche God imputeth not to man, yet that commeth not through the ſmalnes and lyghtnes of the ſynne, but through the mercye of God. And where agayne they affirme that deadly ſinne doth not exclude fayth, but that they maye both ſtande together, they no leſſe deceaue you as hereby appeareth, for S. Paule ſayth: <hi>they that walke after the flesh,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>can not pleaſe God:</hi> wherefore who ſo pleaſeth God walketh not after y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fleſhe, but whoſoeuer walketh in fayth plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth God. Therefore whoſoeuer wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth in fayth walketh not after the
<pb facs="tcp:8358:33"/>
fleſhe, but to walke after the fleſhe is to <note place="margin">Rom. 7</note> walke in deadly ſinne. Therefore they that walke in fayth, walke not in dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">Rom. 8</note> ſinne, whereby it followeth that faith, and deadly ſinne ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not ſtande together. Agayne, whoſoeuer is dead, hath no lyfe in hym, but whoſoeuer hath no life in hym, hath no fayth in hym: <hi>For the iuſte do liue by fayth.</hi> Therefore who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer <note place="margin">Abac. 2 Hebr. 10</note> is dead hath no fayth in him, but they are dead in whom deadly ſynne raygneth: <hi>For hee that ſynneth is the ſeruaunt vnto ſynne.</hi> Therefore they in <note place="margin">Iohn. 8</note> who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> there is deadly ſynne, haue no fayth in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Let thys for a touch or ſay of their errours concernyng deadly ſinne, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. Now touching veniall or remiſſible ſinnes, they may thus be defined. Ueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all ſynnes are all thoſe ſynnes whiche <note place="margin">The defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall ſinnes</note> through fayth are forgéeuen. The truth of thys definityon is euident by theſe woordes of Peter in the .x. of the Actes: <hi>To hym geeue all the prophets witnes, that through hys name all that beleeue</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Act. 10</note> 
                  <hi>in hym shall receaue remyſſyon of ſynnes,</hi> but whatſoeuer is remytted is veniall, for to bée veniall and remyſſible
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:8358:33"/>
is all one thing, and therfore all ſinnes which through fayth are forgeuen are veniall: wherby the truth of the defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion appeareth, and hereby it is eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that no ſinne can be called veniall in reſpect of his owne nature, for ſo it is deadly, but for that through mercy it is remitted, ſo that one and the ſelfe ſame ſinne is in diuers reſpectes both <note place="margin">Deadly ſinne &amp; ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall ſinne are in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects but one.</note> deadely and veniall, for in him where ſayth is, it is veniall, and where faith is not, it is deadly. Whereby it is alſo eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that vnto the wycked no ſynne is denyall, ſo then the dyfference betwene veniall ſinne and deadlye, conſiſteth not in the nature of the ſinne, but in the wil of God, which to the faythfull remitteth <note place="margin">The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene dead<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly ſinne &amp; venial ſinne</note> it, and to the vnbeleuers reteineth it. Now touching the opinion of the ſchole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men concerning veniall ſinne, it is a world to ſée how they turmoyle them <note place="margin">The opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ſcholemen concerning venial ſinne</note> ſelues about it, ſome of them thinke the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be called veniall ſinnes, becauſe they be light and eaſily remitted, or els waſht away with holy water, as they terme it: others thinke it ſo called, becauſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter death it ſhould be remiſſible by the
<pb facs="tcp:8358:34"/>
fire of Purgatorye<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> others thynke them called remiſſible, or venyall in reſpect of the ſinne agaynſt the holy Ghoſt, which is called irremiſſible or vn forgeueable. But the better learned amongſt them, accompt venyall ſynnes the dyſpoſition or proneneſſe towardes the thoughtes, and affectyons whiche leade vnto deadly ſynne. Herein is this one thyng worthy <note place="margin">The ſchole<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>men agree in error<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> the notyng, that howſoeuer they amon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt them ſelues diſagrée in diuerſitie of opinions about the ſame, yet in this one thyng they all agrée, that none of them all taketh either counſell, witnes, or au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritye out of Gods worde concernyng the ſame. The errour of all whiche, can not be hidden from him that conſidereth what hath bene ſayde before. And vpon theſe falſe groundes thy inferre dyuers opinions of corrupt doctrine, whereof I will rehearſe one or two. Firſt they <note place="margin">The falſe opinion &amp; doctrine of the papiſts</note> affirme that ſome ſynnes in the wicked be veniall ſynnes, which is proued falſe. Agayne that venyall ſynnes ſhould be light ſynnes, and not of their owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture damnable. Againe, that they ſhould bée waſhed away wyth holye water, or

Theſe thinges ſuffice for a faſte of their errors herein. Now, foraſmuch as it doth plainly appeare both what originall and actuall ſinne is, it is therby gathered that the difference betwene them is onely this. That in <note place="margin">The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall and actuall ſin.</note> actuall ſinne that which is, as it were the matter or ſubſtance of the ſinne, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth not after it be committed, but onely the giltiſhip or bonde to the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naltie: As when a man committeth whoredome, murther, theft, or any ſuch like, ſoe ſoone as the acte is done, the ſinne is ended, ſo that the whoredome, murther, or theft is paſt and gone, but the giltiſhip and bonde to the penaltie remaineth: but in originall ſinne both the ſubſtance and matter of the ſinne

<pb facs="tcp:8358:41"/>
féeling of the meaning thereof, that no man could pretende ignorance of the ſame, foraſmuche as the whole nature of man trauelleth in continual vſe, and practiſe of loue towardes ſinne and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes. And although mans knowledge concerning the meaning of that woorde, was gathered oute of the fruites of hys corruption, he being as it were ſinne it ſelfe: yet that, neyther hindered his vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandyng of the meanyng therof, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any whit debaſed the puritie of the nature thereof. So that whoſoeuer by thoſe effectes, or properties of loue, whyche hée felt in him ſelfe (towardes ſinne) had ſought the definition thereof, he ſhoulde forthwith haue ſéene how en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire and abſolute a ryghteouſneſſe the law requireth. Wherfore hauyng thus ſpoken of the nature of loue, it ſéemeth now conuenient, to vſe ſome definityon thereof, whereby the truth of my aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may be more apparant: wherefore it may be thus defined.</p>
               <p>Loue is a naturall affectyon of the minde, inflamyng all the powers of the <note place="margin">Definition of loue</note> louer with willing duetie towardes the

Surely if the holy Ghoſt had ſayd no more, but <hi>thou shalt loue the Lorde thy God,</hi> the force and efficacye of loue is by the definition euident to bée ſuche, as it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth a naturall inclination, and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling proneneſſe of all the partes of man to the obedyence of God: wherefore moſt truely it is ſayd of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Apoſtle Paul, <hi>that loue is the fulfillyng of the lawe.</hi> And to take away all ambiguitie, the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">Rom. 13</note> Ghoſt hath added ſuche other words, as dyſcharge hys meanyng herein of doubtfull vnderſtanding.

law: Foraſmuche I ſay, as the heart or minde is the fountaine, or ſeate of all willing deſire, and naturall inclination of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole man, it is playne, that where hée ſayeth, <hi>with all thy heart, and with all thy mynde,</hi> it is all one, as if he had ſayde: thou ſhalt loue thy Lord thy God with all willing deſire, naturall affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and inclination, of the whole man.

He addeth moreouer, <hi>with all thy ſoule,</hi> to ſhew that the law is ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall, and requireth alſo to the fulfilling thereof, all the powers, and intentyons of the ſoule, whych is euident in that Chriſt himſelfe, the beſt expoſitor of the

And laſt of all he addeth, <hi>with all thy ſtrength,</hi> which is a proprietie, <note place="margin">Deut. 6.</note> common both to body and minde. And by adding thereto this worde <hi>[all]</hi> it is plaine that it requireth the ful, natural, and abſolute obedience, of all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> powers of body and ſoule. And hereby ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently appeareth the meaning of the law, namely, that with all willing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, and naturall affection, both of body and ſoule, and all the powers and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the whole man, thou ſhalt yelde obedience to the Lorde thy God: leſſe then the which, the lawe could by no meanes require of man, ſeing therein is nothing commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded but that which the condition of his originall eſtate was created vnto, from the which ſeing the whole man (that is to ſay) body and ſoule, with indeuour and habilitie of
<pb facs="tcp:8358:43"/>
them both is willingly fallen, as is ſhewed in the firſt and ſecond chapters. Whereby it appeareth that mans righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes required in the law, muſt be in him ſo naturally, that the ſame muſt not lurke in him, as an accident which may be remoued from his nature. But all hys whole nature muſt be nothing els, but the Image of righteouſneſſe it ſelfe: the whole man, body, minde, thought, worde, and déede, perfectly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued into the ſame, ſo that the whole indeuour and diſpoſition of nature (through rauiſhing ſway of willing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire and naturall affection vnto righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe) muſt trauell with vnquencha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thirſt the execution of the fruite ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: ſuch muſt be the vnquenchable paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and prone deſire of very nature therunto, that if no law were geuen to traine man to righteouſnes, yet nature her ſelfe would be vnto him a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all &amp; inuiolable law concerning y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame, as hauing no power nor habilitie to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire the contrary: wherof no ſuch exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple can be geuen to make vs féele the truth of this aſſertion as the contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:8358:43"/>
of the pleaſant ſway and willing pronenes of our nature vnto ſinne, who néedeth no law to draw her there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, nay no lawe can kéepe her from it: which is nothing els in déede, but the very oppoſite of the other. So that looke with what willing and naturall plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and delight, the whole diſpoſition of man now trauelleth to the execution of vice and ſinne: the law requireth of all them that ſeeke righteouſnes by the déedes thereof, that with the ſame wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and naturall pleaſure and delight, the whole diſpoſition of them muſt tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell the execution of the workes of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes. So that to be ſhort, as now no lawe is able to holde mans nature from wickednes: ſo the lawe requireth in man, ſuch a naturall and abſolute righteouſnes as no lawe (if any ſuch could be made) ſhould be able to holde his nature from righteouſnes. Hauing thus ſhewed by the lawe of the firſt ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that all workes required in the law to mans reſtitution, muſt procede from a naturall pronenes, and willing deſire of the whole ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto righteouſnes.</p>
               <p>

I ſée no cauſe to tary about the lawe of the ſecond table, which concerneth onely mans dutie towardes his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, euen as the firſt concerneth his duetie towardes God. The lawe is this: <hi>Thou shalt loue thy neighbour as thy ſelfe:</hi> vnto the vnderſtanding <note place="margin">Leuit. 19.</note> whereof, that which is already ſaid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning loue, hath ſo opened the way, that onely this briefe explication therof may ſuffice: namely, thou ſhalt with willing deſire and naturall pronenes of all the powers of the whole man, couet thy neighbours felicitie both in body and ſoule, as much as thine owne. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing now ſufficiently ſhewed y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> nature of the law, and what is required to the fulfilling thereof, it is neceſſary to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare with the ſame, the corrupt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of man, expreſſed in the firſt and ſecond chapters.</p>
               <p>For the playne vnderſtanding wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, it is expedient to vſe ſome definitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> both. The law may thus be defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: The law is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> abſolute rule of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes, which chalengeth to the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling <note place="margin">Definitien of the law.</note> therof, the full obedience, willing
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:8358:44"/>
deſire, and naturall proneneſſe of the whole man. Contrariwiſe, the corrupt nature of man gathered out of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond chapter, is a corrupt diſpoſition in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting <note place="margin">Mans cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</note> the whole man with full obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, willing deſire and luſtfull prone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe vnto ſinne and rebellion: whiche by theſe wordes of <hi>Paule</hi> to the <hi>Rom.</hi> is euident: <hi>It is not obedient to the law of God, nether</hi> it <hi>can be.</hi> And to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>

workes, as though the law chalenged not of man the abſolute performaunce thereof, but a certaine degrée of perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion proportionall to the condition of his habilitie, in ſaying there is perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in children, perfection in men, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection <note place="margin">A falſe and corrupt doctrine.</note> in Angelles, and perfection in God, concluding thereby ſuch a perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion onely, to be required in man as is proportionall to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> condition of his habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, as though in the lawe of God, there were at the leaſt a certayne winc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king at wickedneſſe, alowing ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection as man can attaine, and winc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king at the reſt of his wantes.

For what creature beſides man hath hart, ſoule, and mynde. The daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerouſnes and fearefulnes of this doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine doth hereby appeare, for no man can be ſo wicked, but vnder the lée ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he may finde ſafe harborough to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend

Sir, glory you in the meaſure of your own perfection. I for my parte expreſſe the perfection, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to my habilitie, whiche is as much as the lawe requireth, the leſſe I can performe, the more is my good hap, ſeeyng the law aloweth the ſufficiencie of my ſmall habilitie, for that thereby I haue the more libertye to féede my na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture wyth her daintie delightes.

God I ſay vouchſafed to

renue the ſame agayne, &amp; that in larger <note place="margin">God renued his promyſe for the reſto ring of mankinde Gene. 22.</note> wordes vnto Abraham in ſaying: <hi>In thy ſeede shall all the nations of the earth bee bleſſed.</hi> And the ſame he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in lyke forme of wordes after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes to Iſaac.

But now hée offereth a playne explication of his meaning, concerning the bruſyng of the Serpentes head, namely, that where man by deſpiſyng the commaundement of God, and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng to the ſubtill perſwaſion of the Serpent, was fallen into the curſſe of God: Now was it promiſed that in the ſéede of Abraham all the nations of the <note place="margin">Gene. 22.</note> earth ſhoulde bée bleſſed: that is to ſay, deliuered from that curſſe againe. It is alſo come to a more particularitie, for now the promiſed ſéede is limited with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in one ſtocke: namely, of Abraham. Thus by degrees the purpoſe of God goeth forward more and more openyng it ſelfe, labouring ſtyll to prouoke ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full man to foreſée hys great daunger
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:8358:48"/>
and flye to the promyſed ſéede for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge, whiche notwithſtandyng corrupt ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haſteth ſo faſt after wickednes, that litle hée regarded the condition of hys owne miſerye: wherefore in the rype<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of tyme, God ſeyng the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of man growen to ſo monſtruous an extremitye, that none of all his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer workes, nor frée promyſe coulde wake hys ſluggiſhe hart to conſider his owne miſerye, and ſo prycked by ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitye to flye to the promyſed ſéede, as to the ſhoote ancker of hys ſafetye. God I ſay ſéeyng this, neuer vnmyndefull of hys promyſe, determyneth now final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſet before man ſuch a glaſſe, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in hée coulde no waye flye, nor eſcape from the moſt cleare, and euident ſight of his owne owgely, and monſtruous nature: that lothed with the ſight ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, he forthwith might bée dryuen to flye to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſoueraigne medicine of hys reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: namely to the frée promiſe of God, in the ſéede of Abraham.

Seyng mans reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſtode now only vpon the promiſe, &amp; truth of God, and not vpon the lawe, to the fulfylling of any part wherof, he had loſt both habilitie and inclination.

geuen life, then no doubt righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes shoulde haue come by the lawe,</hi> that is to ſay, if ſuch a law had bene geuen, as corrupt man had bene able to haue performed and kept, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> no doubt hee ſhould haue bene iuſtified by the law. But the law being ſuch, whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to he neither had habilitie nor inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it had onely force to ſhewe vnto hym what hee ought to be, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce vpon him the ſentence of death, and his iuſt condemnation, to force him thereby to flye from thence, to ſéeke his frée reléefe in Chriſt, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> promiſed ſéede to come. But hereunto the aduerſaries obiect, that if God ſhould commaunde <note place="margin">An obiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the papiſtes.</note> vs things vnpoſſible to vs to performe, then ſhould we both be iuſtly diſcharged of blame, &amp; God to be accuſed of cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in condemning vs, for not doyng that whiche by no meanes is poſſible vnto vs. Unto the folie and wickednes of which obiection, it is eaſelie anſwered, <note place="margin">An anſwer</note> that although vnto our corrupt nature it be nowe vtterly vnpoſſible to ſatiſfie the law, yet neither is the law therfore vniuſt or violente, nor God extreme or
<pb facs="tcp:8358:51"/>
cruell in requiryng the performance therof at our handes, for therein is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyng by hym required of vs, but that whereunto in our originall nature he had created vs both able, ſufficient, &amp; naturally inclined, with ful furniture of free choiſe and power to haue executed the ſame: wherof what ſoeuer nowe is wantyng in the habilitie of our corrupt nature, that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth not either by cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in God, or faulte in the lawe, but by our owne wicked and wilful tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, wherby the habilitie therunto is vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly loſt (as is ſhewed before) by ſpoyle of our originall righteouſneſſe. For the law is not geuen as a meaſure, or ſcant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyng of the habilitie of our purchaſed corruption, but as the abſolute rule of our originall perfection. The law doth teache vs howe holy and excellent we were by God created at the firſte, and how fouly by our ſelues, we be now fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len from that we ought to be. The law doth painte vnto vs the excellency of the Image of God, wherunto we were crea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted: if a man by diſeaſe or extreme ſore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of his eyes, be vtterly vnable to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:8358:51"/>
the light, is the light therfore to be thought or iudged violente? Nay, is it not for all that the onely obiect, wherin that ſenſe was naturally created, to haue hys whole vſe and delight? if now the eyes can not behold it, this argueth neither extremitie nor violence in the light, but contrariwiſe, great diſeaſe and corruption in the eyes. So is the law, the natural obiect wherunto mans nature was created, to haue all her mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and ſenſes directed, with naturall felicitie and delight: which if now it be vnable to abyde, that neither argueth extremitie, violence, or crueltie, either in God, or the law: but contrariwiſe great diſeaſe and corruption, in mans nature. And that the obſeruation of the law is vnpoſſible vnto man, as now his nature is corrupted, the teſtimony of theſe Scriptures doe playnely aumuch. Thus writeth <hi>Paul</hi> to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Rom, <hi>for what the lawe could not do, in aſmuch as</hi>

                  <hi>for they are but fooliſhnes vnto hym, neither can he perceaue them, becauſe they are ſpiritually examined.</hi> And Chriſte hym ſelfe ſaith: <hi>how can you ſpeake good thinges ſeeing your ſelues be euill?</hi> And againe: <hi>an euill tree, can bring forth no good fruite.</hi> Hereby ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly appeareth, that the fulfiling of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts is impoſſible vnto ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as hys nature is now corrupt, which by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> laſt Chapter was alſo euident: &amp; that the fathers agréementes with vs here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in

And that whereunto the whole drift of all hys trauell both before the lawe, and in the lawe, and new vnder grace, had the onely reſpecte, as vnto the appoynted ende, that the glory (as of ryght apperteyned) myght be onely hys: namely vppon the condition of hys owne truth, that is to ſay, that as God is true, ſo can he not but accept the ſatiſfaction of Chriſt, the promiſed ſéede, for the full and omniſufficient raunſome of all them that take holde of the ſame, vnto whom of his free fauour he had bound hymſelfe by promiſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernyng the ſame, in promiſing that he ſhould iuſtifie the multitude and beare away theyr ſins.

Now foraſmuche as I know, the aduerſaries will neuer admitte thys definition, becauſe it is the ouerthrowe of their rotten building: Therfore, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what to arme the willing reader, againſt the charmes of their wrangling ſhiftes, I will ſéeke by the ſcriptures, to prous the truth of the ſame, by the parts ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, whiche are theſe: firſt, that it is a frée beneuolence of the will of God ſecondly, that it iuſtifieth the elect through fayth in Chriſt.

Now touchyng the ſecond parte, namely, that grace iuſtifieth the electe through fayth in Chryſt, it is thus proued by theſe woordes of the Apoſtle. <hi>That wee beyng iuſtyfied by grace,</hi>

                  <note place="margin">Eph. 2.</note>

that by grace through fayth we are iuſtified, which was ſecondly to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.

Of the which, the ſecond gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth from this: firſt thus: <hi>Foraſmuch as all they whyche are iuſtified by grace through fayth, are by the free ſpirite of God, regenerate into a new lyfe:</hi> which bréedeth ſuche diſpoſition or ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite as bryngeth forth good-workes, and holy cenuerſation in them. Therefore thoſe good gyftes of God are alſo ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times called grace. Finally that fauour which Chriſt hath with God hys father, and in reſpect of which wée are beloued of the father, is alſo called grace: for Iohn ſayth: <hi>we haue receaued grace for grace:</hi> that is, we are receaued in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the grace of God the father, for that grace or fauour whiche he beareth vnto Chriſt his ſonne.

thynke it not amyſſe, ſomewhat to note the treacherye of thys their heytheneſſe definityon, wyth ſhewes beautified to the ſale, beyng in déede nothyng els but a paynted ſepulchre, conteyning onely a ſtynckyng caryon of <hi>Pelagius</hi> filthy and corrupt hereſie, thoughe aboue all thynges they muſt ſéeme to diſſent from hym, and hys doctrine. And therefore at the firſt, in that they affirme grace to be an habite infuſed into the mynde, they thereby thinke with a pleaſaunt profer, in the begynnyng to daſell the eyes of the worlde from ſuſpition of their ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng handes with hym: the ſubſtaunce of whoſe hereſye beyng well weyed, is neuertheleſſe one, and the ſame wyth this doctrine: wherefore great connyng was to be vſed in this matter, ſeing hys hatefull errour remayned, with great deteſtatyon condemned of the fathers, and therfore they muſt ſeme (at the leaſt in ſome ſuperficiall tryfle) as ſtout ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to diſſent from hym. Wherefore, where his cunning was by <hi>Saint Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine</hi> detected, that though hée vſed the name of grace, yet hée ment nothyng

therby but onely nature. Now theſe me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to auoide this open vew of vnitie, wyth his condemned hereſie. At the firſt gate, or entrie ſéeke ſuch colerable paſſage, as diſſenting from the ſhew of his woordes, maye neuertheleſſe embrace the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaunce of hys hereſie, wherefore not to ſeme that they accoumpt grace to be na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, they terme it an infuſed habite, thinkyng thereby to make it apparaunt, that they meane not any naturall pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er or habilitye. And yet agayne, in that they affirme it to bée lyke vnto the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and loue of God, they thynke them<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſelues to haue géeuen a ſubſtauntyall ſhew, why all they that be therewyth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned, ſhoulde be acceptable vnto God: Namely by reaſon of that lykenes, and ſimilitude to the goodneſſe &amp; loue of God.

And yet S. Iohn ſayth hée loued vs firſt. And Saint Paul affirmeth that our accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:8358:66"/>
with God commeth in reſpect of his owne mercy, And this is here to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that in man hym ſelfe, they place this theyr grace, wherby he is made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable vnto God, makyng hym ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by a cauſe of his owne ſaluation: which errour <hi>Pelagius</hi> held, the falſhode wher <note place="margin">Pelagians hereby.</note> of appeareth partely, by that whiche is ſayd before in the profe of the firſt part of the true definition of grace, where it is euident, that, that grace whereby we be iuſtified, is a frée beneuolence of the will of God. Wherby it is manifeſt how falſly it is ſayd y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> we are iuſtified by any habit powred into our myndes, ſeyng it is by the fauour or grace whiche is in God (and not in our ſelues) wherby he receiueth vs into his mercy. But this definition of theirs is (as I ſayd before) grounded vppon <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> Diuinitie. Now for further profe of their ioynyng with <hi>Pelagius</hi> in the ſubſtaunce of hys hereſie herein: it is nedefull to compare the concluſion, of both the doctrines to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in this point. <hi>Pelagius</hi> affirmed, that the begynnyng of all good workes proceded from our ſelues, namely, from
<pb facs="tcp:8358:67"/>
the frée will and election of man, and that grace dyd onely helpe the poſſibilitie of nature, that theſe workes might more eaſely be performed. Now the Papiſts and Scholemen bycauſe (as I ſayd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) they muſt ſeme to diſſent from him in ſomethyng, affirme that the begyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng of good workes, procedeth not fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> nature, as he affirmed, but from grace. Mary this ſoueraigntie they attributed to nature, that in the will conſiſteth frée power &amp; choyſe, eitther by geuyng place vnto grace, to bryng forth good workes, or els by reſiſtyng the ſame, to omit the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And I praye you from whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce commeth this will, ſeing they cal it frée? could they haue erred more if they had with <hi>Pela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius</hi> affirmed the firſte cauſe of good workes, to come from nature? no aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly: for they place the principall cauſe in frée wil, whiche they place in nature, and vnto grace (though in wordes they geue it the firſt place) yet alowe they it no further power, but onelye to offer it vnto the mynde, leauyng the whole ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraignty vnto nature. Namely fre wil and choyſe to admit, or not admitte the
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:8358:67"/>
ſame, ſo that in this matter they differre from <hi>Pelagius</hi> onely herein, in that hee affirmeth the firſt cauſe of good workes to conſiſte in nature, and the Papiſtes affirme it to conſiſte in grace: But yet vnto that grace they geue no further power but onelye to offer it vnto the mynde, which <hi>Pelagius</hi> neuer denyed, but not to conuert or renew the ſame, wherby grace hath at their handes ſuch ſtraight alowance, that vnleſſe frée will geue it leaue, it is Iacke out of office, and can do nothyng: ſo that with them both, frée wil is he, that ruleth the roſte, whereby they differre a litle in childiſhe ſhewe of wordes, but nothyng in the ſubſtaunce of the hereſie.</p>
               <p>This grace which the Papiſtes haue hunted out is lyke a ſleueleſſe Iacket hangyng in the ayre, which euery man may at hys owne choyſe either ſlyp on, or leaue vntouched. And yet Paule in playne wordes affirmeth, that it is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in hym that willeth, nor in hym that runneth, but in God that pitieth, wherby it is euident that grace doth not only (as they imagine) inuite the mynde
<pb facs="tcp:8358:68"/>
vnto Chriſt, neither as they dreame is it a certaine generall grace common vnto all men, whiche euery one that ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieth hath free will, &amp; power to recaue or refuſe. But it is in déede that frée fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour of God in reſpect of Chriſt, which not onely moueth the minde, but alſo by his ſpirite doth clearely turne, renewe, and regenerate the ſame accordyng to theſe ſayinges of the Prophetes. Thus ſaith Elia, <hi>heare me O Lord, that this</hi>

                  <hi>people may knowe that thou art the Lord God, and that thou haſt turned their hartes agayne nowe at the laſt.</hi> And agayne Ieremy ſayth, <hi>O Lord</hi>

                  <hi>I will plant a new ſpirite within your bowels, that ſtony hart wil I take out of your bodye, and geue you a fleshy hart,</hi> And agayn by Zacharie he ſayth, <hi>I will turne them alſo, for I pitie them.</hi> Here is both taught that God turneth the hart, &amp; alſo the cauſe therof, namely, his mercy, <hi>For I pity them,</hi> ſaith he: ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording wherunto, Dauid cryeth, <hi>make</hi>

                  <note place="margin">Ioh. 6.</note> Surely the Papiſtes ſhew themſelues the naturall heyres of Pelagius, in this theyr definition of grace: As by thys which Auguſtine writeth vnto Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent the Byſhop of Rome, is euident: Pelagius (ſayth he) fearyng to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed in the Paleſtine counſell, dyd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forehand accurſe all ſuch as ſayde they coulde lyue vprightly wythout grace: But by grace he vnderſtoode nothyng els, but the giftes which he imagined was beſtowed vppon vs in creation, as frée choyce, reaſon, will. &amp;c. by which ſubtility the Paleſtine Byſhoppes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng decaued, dyd abſolne hym: in
<pb facs="tcp:8358:69"/>
which déede Saint Auguſtine doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe then for theyr vpright, and ſimple dealyng, for when they heard hym con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe the grace of God, they could there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by vnderſtand no other grace, then that which the Scripture acknowledgeth, namely, the fauour of God, whereby we be regenerate and grafted into Chriſt. By which wordes of Saint Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine it appeareth, that all other ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifications of grace hereunto applyed, are but ſubtill and falſe ſhiftes to dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the truth withall. And is not thys the very ſhift of the Papiſtes? For how much ſoeuer they ſéeme to accompt of grace, they meane nothyng leſſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, then the frée beneuolence of the wil of God in reſpect of Chriſt: but in déede they meane theyr Philoſophicall grace, their infuſed habit, which muſt helpe nature to hatch her broode of good workes, whereby to be iuſtified, if frée wyll be ſo curteous, as to geue her leaue. Neyther do they onely erre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the matter or ſubſtaunce of grace, as appeareth, but alſo about all the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectes thereof. For all thoſe, which are
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:8358:69"/>
but in déede diuers effectes, or proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the fauour or grace of God, they accompt for ſeuerall graces, as where the grace of God preuenting vs, doth ſtirre and moue the mynde vnto good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, that accompt they for one ſeuerall grace, after the which firſt motion, and (as it were) iogging of the mynde, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake the ſame from the deadly ſleepe of rebellious contempt, there worketh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother effect of the ſame grace which performeth the ſame thyng, whereunto the other prouoketh, for it turneth and altereth the vnwillyng mynde, and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth lyfe agayne vnto the dead ſéede of originall obedience: ſo that the mynde which before diſpiſed to obey any of the heauenly motions, of the firſt prouo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king effect of grace, is now by thys o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther effect, ſo chainged and clearely alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that it beginneth to hate the fleſhe whereunto onely before, it wholy and willingly obeyed, ſo that now it hunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, thirſteth, and gredely deſireth the full repayre of the loſt obedience which before it could not but vtterly abhorre: and in reſpecte of thys effecte of grace
<pb facs="tcp:8358:70"/>
which thus chaungeth and turneth the mynde, is grace it ſelfe called workyng grace, which is not ſo called as though thys effect were a ſeuerall grace onely furniſhed wyth that qualitie: but it is ſo called to put a difference betwene thys effect of grace, and another, which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly followeth the ſame. Becauſe that thys effect of grace worketh euer in ſuch a ſubiecte, as neuer willyngly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenteth to the worke of the ſame, for vntill it hath chaunged the mynde, the mynde can conſent to no godlynes, and ſo ſoone as it hath turned the mynde, then is the worke of thys effect finiſhed, which once performed, then forth wyth appeareth that other effecte of grace, wherof I ſpake, namely, that as (in the conuerted mynde) grace willeth &amp; wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the workes of true godlynes, ſo doth the regenerate mynde, both wyll &amp; worke the ſame, and thys effect of grace is called <hi>cooperant,</hi> grace or grace wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king together. And wyth the firſt of theſe two effectes of grace, doth the mynde méete onely paſſiuely, becauſe it is by it vnwillyngly ſubdued to ſuffer
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:8358:70"/>
the workyng of the ſame, and is ſayde in the paſſiue voyce to bée renued or to be turned But with the ſecond of theſe two effectes the mynde doth meete both paſſiuely and actiuely: paſiuely in that it is drawen to wyll and woorke ryghte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, and actiuely in that beyng dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen, it willingly wylleth and worketh the ſame. And all theſe ſeuerall effects of grace, doe the Papyſtes (to builde vp their baggage) accompt for ſeuerall graces, and not for the ſeuerall effect of one, and the ſame frée, and vndeſerued fauour or grace of God, whereby in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of Chriſt, we are reconciled. They alſo accompt grace making acceptable, and grace fréelye geuen for two ſeuerall graces, and yet Saint Paule affirmeth that if it bée not frée, it is no grace. But it is good reaſon to géeue them leaue to erre, that ſéeke for no truthe: for ſo they may myſſe that, they care not what they finde, for that once founde, farwell their market and ſale of all their traſhe. It appeareth by that whiche haue bene ſayde, that in their definition, the name of grace is not applyed vnto the true

                  <hi>genus,</hi> or generall woorde, vnder which all the dyuers propertyes thereof, bée comprehended: but onely vnto one effect thereof, namely that, whereby wée are prouoked vnto good woorkes.

               <p>Thys beyng declared, next com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth fayth to bée conſydered: Namely, in what ſignyfication it is to bée taken, where it is ſayde to iuſtifye, or what that fayth is, thorough whiche wée bée iuſtyfied.

               <p>There is alſo fayth to do miracles, whereof Chryſt him ſelfe ſpeaketh, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng: <hi>Verely I ſay vnto you, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer shall ſaye vnto thys mountayne, take thy ſelfe awaye, and caſt thy ſelfe into the ſea, and shall not wauer in hys heart, but shall beleeue, thoſe thinges whyche hee ſayeth shall come to paſſe, whatſoeuer he ſayeth shall bee done vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to hym</hi> And thys fayth is common as well to the reprobate, as to the elect: as by theſe woordes of Chryſt appeareth. <hi>Many</hi> (ſayth hée) <hi>will ſay to mee in that daye, Lorde Lorde, haue we not by thy name propheſied; and by thy name caſt out deuils? and by thy name done many great woorkes? and then wyll I profeſſe to them, I neuer knewe you.

               <p>Nowe touchyng the ſeconde parte, namely, that it puryfieth the hearts of the receyuers. Peter in the Actes of the Apoſtles affirmeth it in playne woordes, for thus he ſayeth: <hi>He put no difference</hi>

Paule geueth to the Hebrues, it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, if we note the matter wherabout fayth hath his vſe, whiche is the word, &amp; promiſe of God: hys definition is this: <hi>Fayth is the grounde of thinges hoped for, a certaynty of thynges whyche are not ſeene:</hi> In that, he calleth fayth, the grounde of thynges hoped for, and that the thyng hoped for, is the promiſed fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour of God in Chryſt. Therefore is fayth the grounde of the promiſed fauor of God in Chryſt. And what he meaneth by calling it the ground thereof, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentlye
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:8358:73"/>
declareth, in that hée termed it <hi>a certainty of thynges that are not ſene,</hi> whereby it is euident, that by hypoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis or ground, hee meaneth a certayntye, or full aſſuraunce. And vnto fayth, as it were a preſent poſſeſſion of that promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed fauour of God in Chriſt, whyche is yet neuertheles but hoped for, and in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, and not preſent vnto the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, whereby appeareth the truth of that definition whyche I haue put. And by this definition of S.

               <p>Now hauing ſhewed a true definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of fayth, I thinke it not amyſſe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what to note, what the ſcholemen and <note place="margin">The opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Schoiemen and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtes, of Fayth.</note> papiſtes hold concerning the ſame: that thereby their error may partly be appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant.

                  <note place="margin">Sent lib. 3 diſtinct. 23. Cap, 1</note> 
                  <hi>quae non videntur.</hi> Fayth is a vertue, wherewyth thinges are beléeued, that are not ſéene. The generalitie of whyche definition, by a certaine contraction hée preſently ſtreyghtneth thus: Whyche (ſayth he) is not to be vnderſtand of all thynges that are not ſéene, but onely of ſuche thynges as appertaine to religion. In this definition, as the ſcholemen haue handled the matter, lurketh a great and venomous ſubtletye, whyche is, in that vertue is made the <hi>genus</hi> or gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall woorde vnto fayth, whereby fayth ſhould ſéeme to bée contayned in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicament of qualitie, whiche before is ſhewed falſe: and therefore he had af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed before in the. 27. diſtinction of the ſeconde booke, that no qualitye in the mynde can be a vertue, vnleſſe by cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie it be there formed, for thus he wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth there, <hi>Charitas eſt ſpiritus ſanctus, quae animae qualitates informat, &amp; ſanctificat, vt eis anima informetur, &amp; ſanctificetur, ſine qua animae qua'it as non dicitur virtus: Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye is the holy Ghoſt, whyche charytie doth forme and ſanctifie the qualytyes
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:8358:74"/>
of the minde, that by them the minde may be formed and ſanctified, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which charitie, no qualitie of the minde is called a vertue.</hi> Here ſhineth the cauſe of his former foundation in that they make vertue the <hi>genus,</hi> or ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall worde vnto fayth: namely, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he woulde expreſſe fayth to be a qualitie by charitie formed in the mind. And foraſmuch as all qualities of the minde be actions or workes, therefore in that, he imagineth the ſame charitie to forme fayth, he thinketh him ſelfe to haue geuen a ſubſtantiall cauſe, why fayth (in our iuſtification) ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as it is a worke, and not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. So that all his courſe herein, is runne onely to this end: namely, to teach that iuſtification conſiſteth in workes, and that fayth iuſtifieth in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecte that it is a worke, and not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. And that this is his meaning it is plaine by that queſtion, out of the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere whereof his forenamed authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie was alledged, which is this: <hi>Cur ergo dicitur fides mereri iustificationem, &amp; vitam aeternam? ex ea ratione dictum acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitur,
<pb facs="tcp:8358:75"/>
quia per actum fidei meretur illa: VVhy ſayth he, is fayth ſaid to deſerue iuſtification and eternall life? it is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand to be ſaid for this cauſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe by the acte of beleuing, it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerueth thoſe thinges.</hi> Now doth it euidently appeare, why vnto fayth he applied that definition out of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe: about the ſubtiltie wherof this one thing is gathered worthy the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, namely, the ouerthrow of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſchole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens owne ſmoky diſtinction of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and vnformed fayth, wherewith ſo greatly they pleaſe them ſelues, for by thys definition, it is euident, that there is no other fayth, but onely for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ined fayth. But to know what hereby is ment, it is neceſſary to note, that, that qualitie of the minde which by charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble workes expreſſeth it ſelfe outwardly to beleue, they call formed fayth. And againe, that qualitie of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> minde, which likewiſe beleuing, though by charitable workes it declare it not, they call vnfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med fayth, which by the doctrine of this deceauer, is euident to be no fayth at all. For if it be fayth, by hys definition
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:8358:75"/>
it muſt be a vertue, and if it be a vertue, it muſt by hys forenamed authoritie be formed in the minde by charitie, or els he affirmeth it to be no vertue: Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſeing thys their qualitie is vnfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, therefore by hym it is no vertue, and being no vertue by hys definition of fayth, it is no fayth: and that thys is that, which out of hys owne doctrine is to be gathered, it alſo appeareth by this queſtion, which he afterwardes in the 5. queſtion of the 23. diſtinction of the 3. booke putteth <hi>An illa informis quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas mentis, quae in malo Chriſtiano est, fiat virtus cum ſit bonus? VVhether the ſame vnformed qualitie of the minde, which is in an euill Chriſtian be made a vertue, when the man is a good Chriſtian?</hi> Here you plainly ſee that he flyeth the name of fayth, and calleth it an vnfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med qualitie, and not vnformed fayth, knowing that, that vnto hys own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition, had ben a flat antitheſis.</p>
               <p>Thus is it euident, both how their doctrine is at warre within it ſelfe, and alſo that as the ſame is vtterly ſtrange fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> true doctrine of Chriſt, ſo are they
<pb facs="tcp:8358:76"/>
driuen to forge termes of arte accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly for the ſame, ſuch as the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture can not acknowledge: the cauſe whereof may ſéeme to haue bene thys, that for aſmuch as the matter of iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of workes, which is the prowler for all theyr prouiſion is by the whole courſe of the Scriptures ouerthrowen, and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> office therof attributed to fayth: Therfore ſought they ſuch blynd defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of fayth, as in reteinyng the name of fayth for faſhions ſake, myght neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe reſerue vnto workes the ſoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignitie ſtill. Which beyng imagined there remayned this one thing behynd, that for aſmuche as their ende was, to ſeke a generall gayne of all men aſwell of the bad as the good, by this their deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, it was of neceſſitie that this their fayth beyng one of the pillers ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, ſhould conteyne in it ſome ſuch plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible proprieties, as with pleaſaunt allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rementes and ſhewes, myght miniſter matter both to good and bad, to feede the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues with opinion of the poſſeſſion of true fayth, vnder the couloure thereof. For the doyng wherof it was neceſſary
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:8358:76"/>
that it ſhould conteyne in it two diuers kynds, proportionall to the condition of the two diuers ſubiectes, which ſhould poſſeſſe the ſame, namely the good and the bad. And hence ſemeth their ſubtile diſtinction of formed, &amp; vnformed fayth to haue growen. Their formed fayth <note place="margin">The vnfor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>med fayth of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtes.</note> was onely perculiar to theyr good men, ſuch as by theyr charitable workes had formed the ſame, and geuen it the true nature and forme. Namely, by offeryng at pilgrimages, buyldyng chauntreis, bying of pardons, and ſuch other ſtuffe. And their vnformed fayth is a medicine for all hell houndes, and rake helles, for <note place="margin">The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med fayth of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtes.</note> none ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be ſo wicked, but if he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge theyr Churche, they will thus far comfort him, that he may perſuade hym ſelfe that notwithſtandyng all hys vila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, yet hath he in him all good and true fayth, neceſſary vnto ſaluation. Mary they ſay yet it is vnformed. Surely it is lyke to that which hath bene fayned of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Beares whelpe, namely that it ſhould bee whelped a rude lumppe without ſhape, which the dame with the lickyng of her toung doth perfectly forme: So
<pb facs="tcp:8358:77"/>
the poſſeſſours of this theyr vnformed fayth by the lickyng the ſame, not with theyr tunges, but with the charitable workes of theyr purſſe taught in the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les of their holy Churche, may forme it at their owne pleaſure, yea if they lyſt after the beſt faſhion, the more coſt, the more perfection. Truly this ſemeth to to haue bene the grounde of theyr doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine herein, for what ſoeuer they ſay of fayth, they meane thereby no other thyng, but that a ſuperſtitious humble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and blynde obedience to the penny prowlyng doctrine of their counterfeyte Churche, is true and Chriſtian fayth, though the poſſeſſor therereof know nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther how GOD wilbe worſhypped in Chriſt, nor how by hym he is made gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, and mercyfull vnto hym. This is theyr fayth, to beleue nothyng determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately, nor with aſſuraunce of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, but alwayes vnder this condition, if the iudgement of their Churche ſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low of it. This call they a fayth ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t vnto ſaluation: is not this a peſtilent and wicked doctrine, that ſuch as haue no touch of godly feare, nor any féelyng
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:8358:77"/>
of true godlynes, ſhould be ſayd to poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe all true faith neceſſary to ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? where it is proued before in the proffe of the true definition of fayth, that one of the properties of true fayth is, to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie the hartes of all the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that poſſeſſe it. Let this both touchyng the deſcription of true fayth, and the counterfaite faith of the Papiſtes ſuffice, and let vs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede to ſhew in what ſenſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, or iuſtification is to be taken, which fayth by grace apprehendeth.</p>
               <p>For the doyng whereof, it is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to ſhew how diuerſly the word righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes <note place="margin">Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes how it is taken in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and alſo Iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</note> is vſed. Sometyme it is vſed, for that common righteouſnes whiche naturally cleaueth vnto man, wherby, euen in the heathen the oppoſition of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall vertues and generall vices, was vnderſtand, and the contrary eſtimation of both, therby generat. And this righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes is common to all men. In ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſenſe, it is vſed for that outward righteouſnes, which by the good fruites or workes, of ſuche as bee already iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, is apparaunt in the eyes of men. Therefore in neither of theſe ſenſes is
<pb facs="tcp:8358:78"/>
the worde righteouſnes or iuſtification taken in this place, wherfore that which here is ment, may thus be defined. Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, is a frée remiſſion of ſinne &amp; <note place="margin">Definition of iuſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> imputation of righteouſnes, vnto man, through fayth in Chriſt. The truth of this definition is proued, by theſe words of Paul, <hi>Abraham beleued God, and that was imputed to hym for righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes: To him that worketh, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>is not counted of fauor, but of duty, but to hym that worketh not, but beleueth on hym that iuſtifieth the vngodly, hys faith is counted to him for righteouſnes, euen as Dauid deſcribeth the bleſſefulnes of the man vnto whom God aſcribeth ryghteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, without deedes,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Bleſſed are they whoſe vnrighteouſnes are forge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and whoſe ſins are couered: Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed is the man to whom the Lord impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth no ſinne,</hi> by theſe wordes of Paul it is plaine that God iuſtifieth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vngod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly whiche beleueth, by forgeuyng hys vnrighteouſnes, and couering his ſins, and imputation of righteouſnes vnto hym without deedes, and that it is fréely

done Saint Paule alſo declareth <hi>for all</hi> (ſayth hée) <hi>haue ſynned, and are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute of the glory of GOD, and are iuſtyfied freely by hys grace,</hi> therefore is iuſtyfication ryghtly ſaide to bée a frée remyſſyon of ſinnes, and imputation of ryghteouſneſſe vnto man, through faith in Chryſt. Thus hauing declared what iuſtification or ryghteouſneſſe is truely gathered out of the ſcryptures of God: I wyll alſo briefly note what the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtes and Scholemen accompt it to be, wherein you ſhall perceaue the building thereof, to be wholy rayſed from their deuyſed grace, whereof is ſufficyentlye ſpoken: Thus wryteth the mayſter of the ſentences. <hi>Mors ergo Chriſti nos iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Iuſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on taught by the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtes.</note> 
                  <hi>dum per eam charitas excitatur in cordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus noſtris. For the death of Chryſt doth iuſtifie vs, when as by it, charitye is ſtirred vp in our heartes.</hi> By whiche woordes it appeareth, that hée affirmeth the death of Chryſt no otherwyſe to iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie vs, but by excitation or ſtyrring of the mynde vnto good woorkes by them to bée iuſtyfied, ſo that in déede they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt iuſtificatyon to ſignifie nothing
<pb facs="tcp:8358:79"/>
elſe, but a certayne qualitie or vertue, or infuſion of a certayne habit into the mynde, inclyning or mouyng the ſame to goodnes, that by the workes thereby produced, righteouſnes may be attay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. Whyche aſſertion of theirs, affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth ryghteouſneſſe to come of oure ſelues, through our owne woorkes: one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye addyng thys exception, that firſt through the merite of Chryſt, a certaine habyt or preuentyng grace doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clyne the minde to the execution of thoſe workes: whereby iuſtification is attay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: whiche is (both by the true definy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of iuſtification) falſe and alſo by the manifeſt woordes of Saynt Paule, whiche ſo many tymes affirmeth iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to conſiſt in the free imputation of righteouſneſſe, vnto man through faith. Abraham ſayeth <hi>he, beleued God, and that was imputed vnto him for ryghte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe.</hi> It appeareth that theſe men accompt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> generall power or vertue of God, whereby hée produceth and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerueth hys creatures, and whereby (euen in the heathen) certaine morall or ciuill good woorkes are wrought, to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:8358:79"/>
the doers thereof vnto iuſtificaty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Thus are ſome of them not aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to dreame, that ſuche as bée not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate, may do ſuche good woorkes as maye merite the firſt grace (as they call it) whereby the mynde beyng ſtyrred hath by their doctryne, frée wyll to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the ſame, whichebeyng once admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, certayne woorkes of ſuche perfection are thereby produced, as in a ſort bée ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to God, and do meryte the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour of Chryſt, and in a ſort do iuſtyfie: though not by full and exact worthineſſe, yet by a certayne conuenyencye or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruencye (ay they call it) accordyng whereunto, they name theſe woorkes congruent merites. That is to ſay, ſuche merites as in equitie deſerue fauour, though they ſatiſfie not the extremitie of the lawe. And theſe firſt works they call preparing workes, meanyng that ſuche prepare the doers vnto regeneratyon. Thys their diuinitie ſéemeth to bée ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered oute of thys ſentence in the ciuyll law: <hi>Summum ius, Summa iniuria, extreme ryght, is extreme wrong.</hi> And therfore they wyll ſcan wyth God the equitie of
<pb facs="tcp:8358:80"/>
the lawe, inferryng thereupon, that by the power of nature, man is able to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill the commaundement, in aſmuch as appertayneth to the ſubſtaunce of the worke required therein, though not ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in ſuche ſort as the intent of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunder requireth, that is, though the doyng thereof procéedeth not from loue and the ſpiryte, they bée able to ſatiſfie the equitie (as it were) of the commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, though not the rigor or extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie thereof, and hereby appeareth howe fully agayne they haue wallowed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues from euill to worſſe, till at length they be perfectly tumbled agayne into a Pellagian hereſie: for by what ſoeuer good worke nature hath power and frée wyll before iuſtificatyon, to meryte the firſt grace wythall, ſeeyng by that firſt grace once obtayned, iuſtification doth by their congruence follow, it is of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity that that firſt meritorious work, is the cauſe of thys their iuſtificatyon, and ſo nature hath of it ſelfe in equitie, power to iuſtifye.</p>
               <p>The horrible error of which doctrine is more then euident, by that whiche
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:8358:80"/>
hath bene ſhewed before, aſwell by the true definition of iuſtification, as by the fourth and fifth chapters, where the fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thynes of corrupt nature is euidently declared. Let thys touching the true ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification of righteouſnes, or iuſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the errors of the Papiſtes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the meaning therof, ſuffice.</p>
               <p>Now reſteth ſomwhat to be ſaid concer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ning workes. Wherefore in one ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, workes are thoſe thynges which by practice of arte are done, and appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly remayne, as all thyngs wrought by any handy craft, are called y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> workes of the doer. In another ſignification, workes are the actions of men, produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced <note place="margin">Definition of workes.</note> by the willyng motion of the mind, which alſo admit another deuiſion. For <note place="margin">Inward workes.</note> ſome of them be onely inward workes, or workes of the mynde, as to beleue, to hope, to feare, to loue, and ſuch like. And ſome other are from the mynde <note place="margin">Outward workes.</note> produced into external, or outward acte, to geue geue almes, to ſuccor, to preach, to teach, and ſuch lyke. All which be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led outwarde workes. And workes in both theſe latter ſignifications, be thoſe
<pb facs="tcp:8358:81"/>
whereof in thys matter is ſpoken: but for ſo much, as ſome of them be good and ſome euill, therefore, that the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence may appeare, good workes may thus be defined. Good workes are one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">Definition of good workes.</note> ſuch workes as in the commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes of God be required, or in any other place of Scriptures (for the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther explication of them) expreſſed: which tend to the true worſhip of God, and outward witneſſing of mans electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in Chriſt. The truth of thys definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is thus proued: for the firſte parte: Namely, that all the workes be good, whiche in the commaundementes, or any other place of the Scriptures for theyr further explication be appointed: It is euident, for ſo muche as hereby we know them to be good workes, for that by God, the doyng of them is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that they tende to the true worſhippyng of GOD, it is thus proued by Chriſt hymſelfe, where he ſayth: <hi>Let your lyght ſo ſhyne before</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Math. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>men,</hi> (he telleth the ende wherefore it ſhould ſhine, namely) <hi>that others ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:8358:81"/>

Notwithſtandyng theſe authorities of Scriptures and fathers, yet do the <note place="margin">Sola fides.</note> aduerſaries kéepe ſtyll theyr braſen fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and ſtoutly ſweare it &amp; ſtare it out that none but heretickes and ſchiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tickes affirme that onely faith iuſtifieth. Truely, gentle reader, if thou béeſt not ſetled in error, thou ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſt not but ſee their wicked and ſhameles facing, in crying out that we corrupt the ſcriptures, and that none of the fathers gathered out any ſuch ſenſe, or meanyng of them, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which matter, thou haſt heard diuers of them, tell theyr owne tales. Now it is here principally to be noted, that wher mans iuſtification is a free remiſſion of ſinnes, and imputation of righteouſnes vnto hym, through fayth in Chriſt: it may be, that becauſe the phraſe of the Scriptures, &amp; of theſe aucthorityes attribute the ſame ſo many tymes to fayth, that therefore ſome myght gather thereby, that fayth is the efficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t cauſe of <note place="margin">Fayth is not the effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient cauſe of our iuſti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fication but God only.</note> mans iuſtification which is not ſo, for the efficient cauſe is onely God: eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as ſinful ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> deſtitute of Gods grace, is the mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall cauſe, and as the declaratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Gods

And foraſmuch as vnto this worke two inſtrumentes were requiſite: the one to be vſed by God, whiche was Chryſt: of whom hée made the ſacrifice and offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryng, the other to be vſed by man whiche is fayth. Therefore that fayth beyng (as I ſaide) the inſtrument, whiche taketh holde of the promyſe, hath relation vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the obiecte of fayth: Namely, vnto Chryſt, and the promyſe: and ſo hath the title of iuſtification imputed vnto it, for ſo ſayth the Scripture. <hi>Abraham be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued God, and God imputed that to him for righteouſneſſe.</hi> Whyche Paule dyuers tymes rehearſeth, to ſhewe that fayth is not the efficient cauſe of iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catyon: but the obiecte of fayth: Name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye Chryſt, and the promyſe.

before iuſtification, no good workes can be wrought, and that the ende of good woorkes is not to iuſtifie the doers of them, but onely to the glory and prayſe of God. Wherefore let vs conſider his woordes, firſt in that he ſayth that ye may be pure and without offence, he ſheweth what is the office of a chriſten man, namely, to labour for ſuch pure and vnſpotted conuerſation, as no of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence may iuſtly be gathered by the ſame He ſayth moreouer, <hi>Vntill the day of Chriſt:</hi> to ſhewe that the ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour towardes goodnes muſt haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance, through the whole courſe of the life. Hauing thus ſhewed both the office of a chriſten man, and the terme of his continuance in thexecution there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: he goeth forward to ſhew what fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture is neceſſary in him to the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of that office: in ſaying: <hi>Filled with the fruits of righteouſnes.</hi> Here he ſheweth wherwith he muſt be filled, that muſt be pure and without offence: namely, with the fruit of righteouſnes, that is, with good workes. And as he tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth in theſe wordes y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> good workes are
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:8358:102"/>
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> furniture of a chriſten ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: ſo doth hée alſo teache in the ſame woords, both the formal cauſe, &amp; the material cauſe of good woorkes: for in that he ſayeth, <hi>wyth the fruites of righteouſnes,</hi> he ſheweth that righteouſnes or iuſtificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is the formal cauſe of them: which as a good trée bryn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth forth her good fruite: He alſo ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that the materyall cauſe of any good worke is, that it is a fruite of ryghteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, whereby it is clearer then y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Sunne, that there can be no fruite of ryghteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe vntill the brynger forth thereof, be tranſformed into a trée of righteouſnes, neither can the material cauſe haue her being, vntil firſt the formal cauſe bée ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate: for the trée muſt bée before the fruite. And in thys place doth Paule o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen the wordes of Eſay in the. 61. chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter where he ſayeth, <hi>they shall be called trees of ryghteouſneſſe,</hi> whyche cauſe Paule doth inſinuate by expreſſyng the effect: in that hée ſayeth, <hi>filled wyth the fruites of ryghteouſneſſe,</hi> which imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that the bryngers forth of thoſe frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, muſt néedes bee tréees of ryghteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: whereby it is euydent that no
<pb facs="tcp:8358:103"/>
woork is good, but that which is brought forth by a righteous man: ſeeyng that it is the fruite of righteouſneſſe: but none is a righteous man vntill he be iuſtified, therefore can none bring forth good wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes, but ſuche as bee alreadye iuſtyfied. Wherupon it followeth, that before iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> no good woork can be wrought. Paule goeth forwarde and ſayth: <hi>whiche fruites are in you by Ieſus Chryſt.</hi> Here doth he euidentlye declare what is the efficient cauſe of good woorkes, namely, Ieſus Chryſt: ſo that where before hee had taught iuſtification, or righteouſnes to bee the formall cauſe of good woorkes, and the fruites thereof to be the mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall cauſe, for that hée woulde leaue no doubt concernyng the effycyent cauſe, therefore he addeth, whiche fruites are in you by Ieſu Chryſt. Where thys is alſo to be noted, fully agréeing with that which is ſayd already, namelye, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> no good woorke can bée wrought, but by him in whom Ieſus Chriſt doth raigne, that is, by y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> iuſtified: for hereby it is playne y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> no good worke can be in man, onles it be by Ieſus Chryſte: but Ieſus Chryſt wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:8358:103"/>
onely in the iuſtified: <hi>for his ſpirit doth certifie their ſpirites in whom hee dwelleth, that they are the children of God: there is no condemnation to them that are in Chryſt Ieſu:</hi> And in this place doth Paule alſo go forward in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutyng the woorde of Eſay, for where Eſaye calleth them trées of ryghte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, that is to ſay the bringers forth of the fruites of ryghteouſnes: he addeth a plantyng of the Lordes, to ſhew that their ryghteouſneſſe is the Lordes worke, and that doth Paule open here where hée ſayeth, <hi>that good workes, or fruites of righteouſneſſe are in vs by Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chryſt:</hi> as though he had ſayd, Ieſus Chryſte hath, made you to bée trees of ryghteouſneſſe, that you myght bring forth the fruites thereof, namelye, good workes, and ſo declare your ſelues to be a plantyng of the Lordes. Thys beyng taught, Paule goeth forward in decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryng the finall cauſe of good workes, in ſaying, <hi>Vnto the glorye and prayſe of God,</hi> whereby it is playne out of theſe words of Paules, that Chryſt is the effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t cauſe of good workes, and that none
<pb facs="tcp:8358:104"/>
can bée wrought, but by hym in whom the ſpirite of Chryſte dwelleth, that is, none can be wrought but by the ryghte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, or iuſtified, in that he ſaith, <hi>whyche fruites are in you by IESVS Chryſt.</hi> Whereby it is playne, that wythout Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chryſte they can not bée in them. Where alſo is declared the materiall cauſe of good woorkes, Namely, a fruite of ryghteouſneſſe, ſo that vnleſſe it bée brought forth by a ryghteous tree, it can bée no good worke: hee alſo declareth that the iuſtification or ryghteouſneſſe of the doer of them, is the formall cauſe of them, in that hée calleth them the fruite of ryghteouſneſſe, for that declareth the doers of them to bée trées of ryghte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe as Eſay termeth them: wherby alſo appeareth, that no good worke can bé done, but by a man already iuſtyfied: hee alſo telleth the finall cauſe of them, in that hée ſayeth, <hi>Vnto the glory and prayſe of God,</hi> concludyng euen as E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay in the fore named place doth. For after hée had ſayde that they myght bée called trées of righteouſneſſe, a planting of the Lordes, hée addeth for hym to
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:8358:104"/>
haue glorye in, ſo that the ende of good woorkes is not to iuſtifie the doers, but to glorifie God: for vnles the doers had bene iuſtified, before the woorkes were wrought, they coulde haue bene no frute of righteouſneſſe. So that thys place of Paule, is an openyng of the forenamed place of Eſay, for where Eſaye ſayeth, <hi>that they myght bee called trees of ryghteouſneſſe,</hi> Paule expoundeth that to bée, <hi>that they shoulde bryng foorth the fruites of righteouſneſſe:</hi> and where Eſaye calleth them <hi>a plantyng of the Lordes:</hi> that doth Paule open, when he telleth <hi>that the fruite of ryghteouſneſſe muſt be in them by Ieſu Chryſt.</hi> And where Eſay ſayeth, <hi>for hym to glorye in,</hi> Paule ſayeth, <hi>to the glory and praiſe of God.</hi> Thus by, comparyng toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther theſe woordes of Paule, and Eſay, it is more then euident that good workes bée ſo farre from iuſtyfiyng the doers, that before iuſtificatyon no good worke can bée wrought. And Chryſt himſelfe affirmeth no leſſe, when he ſayeth, <hi>that the tree muſt bee good before it bryng foorthe good fruite: Euerye good tree</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:8358:105"/>
(ſayeth he) <hi>bryngeth forth good fruite.</hi> So that firſt hée acknowledgeth the trée to bée good, before it bryngeth forth good fruite. <hi>And if the tree be euill,</hi> he affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth in the ſame place, <hi>It bryngeth foorth euill fruite,</hi> concludyng playnely that no euyll tree can bryng forth good fruite. Whereby it is euident, that the man muſte by fayth bée made good, that is to ſaye, righteous and iuſtyfied, before he can bring forth any good woorkes. So <note place="margin">Good wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes follow iuſtification &amp; not iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication worke.</note> then the woorke is acknowledged for good, through mercy, which couereth the blemiſhes thereof, in reſpect that it is the worke of a man, by fayth already iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and clothed in the righteouſneſſe of Chryſte: and not in reſpecte of it ſelfe, which compared with the iuſtice of God, is wickedneſſe, as in the, 9.

                  <hi>God deſireth in man more the knowledge of God, then burnt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frynges.</hi> And before in hys fourth chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: where he geueth a reaſon of the deſtructyon of hys people, he alleageth onely lacke of knowledge, <hi>my people</hi> (ſayeth he) <hi>are deſtroyed for lacke of knowledge.</hi> And Chryſt himſelf ſayth: <note place="margin">Mat. 12.</note>

And therefore doth Dauid crye: <hi>Geeue mee vnderſtanding, and I shall keepe thy lawe, O geeue mee vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng that I maye learne thy commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dementes.</hi> And that good woorkes are <note place="margin">Pſal. 119</note> wrought through knowledge or vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, it is by the ſcriptures euident: Paul to the Phillippians writeth thus: <hi>And thys I praye, that your loue maye abound yet more and more in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and vnderſtanding, that ye maye

diſcerne things, that differ one from an other, that ye may be pure and without offence, vntill the day of Chriſt.</hi> Here doth Saint Paule not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pray, that theyr loue might abound in knowledge, but he alſo telleth the cauſe of hys prayer, namely, that they might be able to diſcerne thynges that differ: to iudge betwene good works, and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeite workes: betwene true religion &amp; hipocriſie: that ſo through that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, they might haue iudgement, how <note place="margin">we cannot leade a pure &amp; chriſtian life, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the knowledge of the will of God. Phil. 1.</note> to lead a pure and Chriſtian life: which, without the knowledge of the wyll of God, is vnpoſſible. And agayne y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame Paule to Philemon: <hi>See that the fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>that thou haſt in the fayth be fruitfull, through know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of all good things which are in you by Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> Hereby it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, that without vnderſtanding of the will of God, no good workes can be wrought. But Paul playnely affirmeth, that all thei that be not already iuſtified in Chriſt, haue no vnderſtanding. <hi>The naturall man</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>perceaueth not the thinges, that belong to the <note place="margin">1. Cor. 2.</note>
                     <pb facs="tcp:8358:107"/>
ſpirit of God, for they are but folish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes vnto hym.</hi> Then if he perceaue not, nor vnderſtand the thynges that pleaſe God. It appeareth by that is ſayd before, that he can by no meanes do the worke that ſhall pleaſe God. Hereby it both playnely appeareth that the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the wyll of God, is required to good workes, and alſo that none that is not iuſtified, hath that knowledge.</p>
               <p>Now touching that vnto good works, there is alſo required in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> doer affection, &amp; delight, towardes y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is euident by the definition of good workes, expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the 8. chapter: where it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth that they be nothyng but an execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the commaundementes: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto the whole affection of man, both body, and ſoule is required as in the. 4. chapter appeareth: which alſo is confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the example of thoſe of whoſe good workes, the ſcripture beareth wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. Thus ſayth Dauid, <hi>If my delight</hi>

In Geneſis he ſayth thus, <hi>my ſpirite shall not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes ſtriue in man, becauſe he is fleshe.</hi> And a litle after, <hi>The Lord ſawe that the wickednes of man was great in the earth, and all the imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the thoughtes of his harte were onely euill continually.</hi> And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne <note place="margin">Man of his owne nature, hath affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſſion, and Iuſt to all wickednes.</note> in the 8. chapter, <hi>the imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of mans hart is euill, euen from hys youth.</hi> Here appeareth, that the affection of the naturall man is onely this, affection to rebellion, deſire ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,
<pb facs="tcp:8358:108"/>
and luſt to diſobedience. Thus it is euident, that in all thoſe which be not already iuſtified in Chriſt, their is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vnderſtanding how to pleaſe God, nor affection thereunto. And ſo conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently no good worke, ſeing it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued that no worke ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be good, but where both they be ioyned together, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo is euident by that which is ſayde in the fifth chapter.</p>
               <p>Surely if theſe men had bene as care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſearchers of truth herein out of Gods holy worde: as they haue bene of miſtes, and clowdes out of Ariſtotles ſchole, to darcken &amp; ſhadow the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes thereof, they woulde neuer haue ſought with ſo many ſubtil diſtinctions, and falſe definitions (without al ground of Gods worde) to haue builded them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, <note place="margin">The Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtes haue buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded a labi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror and a ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But they not conſidering that to be the prayſe, and glory of hys owne grace, and enforcing the rigor of
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:8358:108"/>
the outward ſounde of ſome wordes in the ſcripture, haue gathered workes to be the cauſe of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s iuſtification, where, (if they more narrowly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidered) they ſhould ſee that faith is the onely meane, by which workes are indued wyth the title of goodnes: foraſmuch as no good worke can be wrought, but by a man al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redy by faith iuſtified, and appareled wyth the righteouſnes of Chriſt: by meanes whereof, the blemiſhes and imperfections thereof, are through mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy couered: which otherwiſe, if the ſame workes were wrought by an vnbeleuyng man: they woulde ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare in the ſight of God moſt filthy, for of mercy it commeth (in reſpecte of Chriſt) that the moſt perfecte workes are not layde to mans charge for ſinne. Out of this ground, gathered from God truth, this rule of Chriſtian re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is concluded: that where ſoeuer righteouſnes, or iuſtification is in the Scripture imputed to workes: it is not imputed to them, as though they were the cauſe of righteouſnes: that is to ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as though they going before iuſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb facs="tcp:8358:109"/>
did procure or purchaſe the ſame: but farre otherwyſe: it is imputed vnto them, as vnto the fruit of the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of fayth, which after iuſtification doth witnes, and declare that the doer is iuſtified by fayth, by apprehending of Chriſt: in reſpecte of whom, mercy couereth the ſpottes of that worke, from the ſight of Gods iuſtice, ſo that ſinne is not imputed to man for the ſame. <hi>Hic murus ahaeneus esto: Let this to a Chriſtian conſcience be a wall of braſſe,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now this foundation layde, let vs ſéeke (by thys rule) to vnderſtand thoſe Scriptures, which the aduerſaryes (for theyr filpurſſe doctrine of iuſtification of workes) haue forced into open com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat both agaynſt theyr owne naturall ſenſe, and agaynſt the ende and ſcope of Gods purpoſe, declared in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, touching mans iuſtification: wherein to ſéeke to anſwere to all theyr ſubtill and ſhameles wranglings, were more tedious then profitable. And (tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the multitude of wordes) more paynefull then poſſible. Though tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching matter (Gods truth being iudge)
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:8358:109"/>
inough hath bene ſayd already, where-fore to auoyde all extremities, and kéepe my ſelfe within my power touching wordes: (and yet not to paſſe the reſte with ſilence) I will ouerlooke a fewe of their principall ragges, which they call reaſons, wherein theyr errour being o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, the ſmaller, of them ſelues will drop a ſunder vntouched. Wherefore firſte of all, that playnnes might be ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with the breuitie for which I labor: let the Scriptures which they make challengers in thys fraye, be gathered together into theſe ſortes. In the firſt ſort placyng thoſe which promiſing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to workes, procure men to labour for the ſame. In the ſecond ſort, ſuch as by the ſound of wordes, ſéeme to take iuſtification from fayth, or geueth the ſame to workes. And in the laſt ſorte thoſe Scriptures wherin the righteous thallenge at Gods handes reward of theyr innocency &amp; righteouſnes. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by examples of euery of theſe ſorts, let vs ſéeke truely to vnderſtand them, by theyr agréement with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues and the reſt of the Scriptures: that as of
<pb facs="tcp:8358:110"/>
God there is but one ſpirite, and one truth, ſo the ſame truth, by the conſent of the whole Scripture together may bee acknowledged. For we may not wreſt ſuch ſenſe out of the Scripture (by vrging the outward barke of ſome particular places therein) as ſhall ſet them at ſtrife with all the reſte of the body of the Scripture: and ſo imagine the ſpirite of truth at warre with hym ſelfe. Wherefore for the firſt ſorte let theſe authorites ſerue: <hi>Euery man shall enioye good according to the</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Such ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tures as promiſing reward to workes, procure men to laboure for the ſame, are aunſwered and expoun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ded.</note> 
                  <hi>fruites of his mouth: and after the workes of his handes shall he bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded.</hi> Agayne: <hi>The ſonne of man shall come in the glory of hys father, with his angels, and shall reward eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man according to his deedes.</hi> And agayne: <hi>God is not vnrighteous, that he should forget your worke and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, that proceedeth of loue, which loue ye shewed towardes his name, in that ye haue miniſtred vnto the Sainctes, and yet miniſter.</hi> Theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples may ſerue for their argument of thys ſort: Well ſay they, ſeing that
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:8358:110"/>
mans rewarde is accordyng to hys wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes, it appeareth that in workes there is merite: and that to mans iuſtyfication, woorkes are requyred. Here I myght briefly aunſwere that all theſe woordes, are ſpoken of woorkes comming after iuſtyfication, whyche is not the matter in queſtyon betwene vs, for the queſtion is about woorkes goyng before iuſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for the purchaſe thereof.

thus. Paule (ſay they) hath nothing <note place="margin">The reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the aduerſarirs</note> more ſtrongly to proue iuſtification of fayth: then that the Scripture impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth faith vnto Abraham, for righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes: wherefore if now we can ſhewe, that God alſo in the Scriptures impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth righteouſnes vnto workes: haue not we our iuſtification of fayth and workes, and not yours of faith onely? It is ſayde of Phinées in the 106. Pſal. that his acte was imputed to him for righteouſnes: And likewiſe in Deutro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy of hym that deliuered his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors pledge, that it ſhal be righteouſnes vnto him, before the Lord his God. And likewiſe S. Iames ſaith, <hi>was not Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham our father iuſtified by workes? in offering his ſonne Iſaac vpon the aul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter?</hi> Whereupon they conclude, that as man is not iuſtified by workes: ſo is he not iuſtified by faith without workes: flatly agaynſte S. Paule, who conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth playnely, that man is iuſtified of fauour through fayth without workes <note place="margin">Man is iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row fayth wythout workes.</note> where he telleth both the finall cauſe of that liberall gifte (namely, the prayſe and glory of the grace, or fauor of God)
<pb facs="tcp:8358:123"/>
and alſo he telleth the reaſon why he ſo vehemently excludeth workes, namely, leaſt any man ſhoulde beaſt: that is, through blinde preſumption ſhould chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge any part of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> glory of that worke, which God hath reſerued to himſelfe for his ſpeciall triumph: Now if the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries will néedes vrge that the worde, righteouſnes, or iuſtification, hath the ſame ſignification in theſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> alleged, that it hath in Paule: Doe they not teare in ſunder the ſpirite of truth, and ſet him at warre with hym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe? foraſmuch as by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> rigor of wordes they be contrary. Paule ſayth fiatly, and affirmeth it by manye diſcourſes that faith without worke iuſtifieth: and <note place="margin">Rom. 3.</note> that by workes no man liuing ſhall be iuſtifyed: but theſe aucthorities affirme <note place="margin">Gal. 2. 25y works no man li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ſhalbe iuſtified.</note> the contrary, that theſe men by workes were iuſtifyed.</p>
               <p>Now if they will néedes affirme that both in Paul, and in theſe places which they alledge the worde righteouſnes, or iuſtifycation hath one ſenſe: is not this a doctrine that eyther muſt accuſe Paule of ignorance of the ſenſe of the auncient
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:8358:123"/>
ſcriptures, or of error in his owne, and robbe God of his finall triumph, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, of his glorie, and vtter ſpoylinge man of the aſſuraunce of Gods fauour in Chriſt: for if his aſſuraunce therof bee once ioyned with the condition of hys owne deſert or workes: ſurely he fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth by and by into one of our Phiſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons new found Agewes: A triple terti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an quotidian: he can neuer know when he is without a fitte. Surely it were to hard for <hi>Peter Lumbard</hi> him ſelfe, with <note place="margin">Peter Lom bard.</note> both his foundations of hope, to ſpy out a time to finde him ſelfe cleare from a fitte: if for one maſſe whyle, on the Sunday, his imagination coulde mocke him that he were créeping to godward: The true teſtimony of his conſcience might aſſure him, that all the reſt of the wéeke after, he were gallopping to the deuilward. The Lord hath bleſſed hys elect from ſuch aſſuraunce. Wherefore let vs now reuerently with Paule haue reſpect vnto the finall ende of Gods woorke in this cauſe.

<pb n="109" facs="tcp:8358:124"/>
vnto the finall cauſe of Gods pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. Namely (as I haue often ſaid) that vnto hys fauour, and grace for this ſo frée a benifite, all prayſe and glory may redou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de. That al workes wrought by man before iuſtification, be nothing els but the euill fruite of an euill tree, it is before euidently proued: And ſo vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly vnable to abide the preſence of gods iuſtice. Wherby it foloweth of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie, that the woorkes alleged (in theſe their authorities) were not there meant, for works going before iuſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; as cauſes therof, but in déede, for ſuch workes as folowyng the ſame, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared <note place="margin">Workes fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</note> manefeſtly the righteouſneſſe which (to the doers of them) was offrée fauour through fayth imputed. For that the workes of a man (by fayth) already iuſtified, be in the ſight of God allowed for ryghteous, by not hauing ſinne im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted vnto them: it is not onely not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed, but moſt conſtantly affirmed. For how can it be otherwiſe, but that God in beholdyng in them hys owne moſte glorious Image, wherewith throughe grace in reſpect of fayth they be clothed.
<pb facs="tcp:8358:125"/>
He muſte both acknowledge it, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light therin. But that their ſpottes and blemiſhes are nowe couered wyth the righteouſnes of Chriſte, this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth not to them either by them ſelues, or in reſpect of them ſelues, but onely by grace or fauour through fayth: as is ſhewed before. For they beinge the workes of a man, already by fayth iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and clothed in the righteouſnes of Chriſt: Therfore they (thereby clothed in the ſame righteouſnes, hauing theyr ſpottes and blemiſhes through mercye therewith couered) are acknowledged for righteous. They are accepted for good fruite, becauſe they were brought forth by a good frée. So that fayth by apprehendyng of Chriſt, and his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes in the promiſe, through grace and fauour, attayneth mans iuſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: <note place="margin">Fayth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehendeth righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and workes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion.</note> So the workes or fruites of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame faith, do manyfeſtly declare and witnes, the doer of them to be righteous. That is, as fayth appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>he<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth righteouſnes in the frée promiſe for man: ſo the workes or fruites of that righteouſnes of fayth, doe declare and
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:8358:125"/>
teſtifie that hee is iuſtifyed. Wherefore, wherſoeuer in the Scriptures man is ſayd to be iuſtifyed by workes: the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is, that he is by workes declared and knowen to bée a righteous man. And not that the workes were the cauſe of his righteouſnes. This being thus conſidered, ther appeareth betwene Paule, and the aucthorities by them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, no ſtrife, but moſt ſwéete agrée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For as Paule telleth the meanes howe a man is iuſtifyed: ſo the other ſhew and declare howe man is open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly knowne to bee righteous or iuſtifyed. Now marke gentle reader, how this doctrine tendeth fully to that end, where unto Saint Paule directeth hys courſe: Namely, that the whole glorie may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound to GOD alone: and that man may haue a ſure poſſeſſion of Gods fauour in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Firſte, in that by iuſtifycation of workes, this onely is to be vnderſtand, that man by workes is declared to bée righteous: it concludeth (euen as in the aunſwere to theyr former aucthorities) that all the world may acknowledge the
<pb facs="tcp:8358:126"/>
performaunce of Gods mercyful pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe in Chriſt, towardes the electe. Who by their workes are euidently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared <note place="margin">Good wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes declare vs to bee righteous.</note> to bée righteous. And beſides that it reſerueth the whole glorye of that worke to GOD alone, foraſmuch as workes doe onely declare, and witnes mans righteouſneſſe, and challenge to bee no cauſe of the ſame. Thus vnto God is his prerogatiue reſerued vnble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhed: Namely all the glorie.</p>
               <p>Nowe touching man, in that they declare the certaine poſſeſſion of the righteouſneſſe of fayth, they witneſſe in him the eſtate of a moſte quiete, and ioyfull conſcience, and that hée is through faith, aſſured of the fauour of God in Chriſt. Nowe it is apparant, what righteouſnes of the Scripture at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributeth to faith, and what to workes. Namely, that by faith man apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth Chriſt in the promiſe, by whome he <note place="margin">Fayth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehendeth Chriſt, by whom we are made righteous.</note> is made righteous: and by workes or frutes of the righteouſnes of faith, ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is declared and knowne to bee righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous: and hath his conſcience therby re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in the ſure poſſeſſion of Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:8358:126"/>
in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Thus hauyng ſhewed what iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation the Scriptures attribute vnto workes, I thincke it alſo conuenient to ſhew what fayth it is, which Iames di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſableth to iuſtification.

<pb n="113" facs="tcp:8358:128"/>
that the death, or ſacrifice of hys ſonne, could nothing at all hinder the promyſe of God: but that notwithſtanding God both coulde, &amp; woulde performe his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe and worde. Thus was hys faythe witneſſed by hys woorkes. And the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectnes thereof made apparant, ſo that the truth of the Scripture (which ſayde: <hi>Abraham beleeued God, and that was imputed to hym for ryghteouſneſſe)</hi> was by hys woorkes made ſo euydent: that hée was indued wyth the name of ryghteous, and was called the frend of God. Whereby it is euydent vnto you, that by déedes, as the fruites of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe of his faith, his righteouſneſſe was declared: and hée knowen for a ryghteous man: and not by the idle name of fayth onelye, without workes, which (as I ſayde before) is dead, and no faythe at all.

thys whiche you terme fayth, hauyng no workes to witnes the ſame vnto you is dead, and no fayth at all, but a vaine or lyght opinion. Thus to hym (that with a ſingle eye, conſydereth both the end of S. Iames hys purpoſe, and alſo throughly the order of hys woordes) it appeareth playnly, that hée enueigheth <note place="margin">S.

                  <hi>doe, that hee might haue eternall lyfe, Chriſt aunſwered, if thou wilt enter into lyfe, keepe my commaundementes:</hi> here ſay they, it appeareth, that kéeping <note place="margin">The keping of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes of God were hable to iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtify vs, if we were ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue them Leuit. 18</note> of the commaundementes (whiche is but woorkes) do iuſtifie.

Wherefore (gentle reader) marke the circumſtaunce: firſt who aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the queſtion. A ruler or Lawier, who dreamed of nothyng, but the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward obſeruaunce of the lawe. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, what is the queſtion: namely, What good thing hée might doe, to haue euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting lyfe? Marke, that this hys whole queſtion was not otherwiſe to learne the waye to euerlaſtyng life, then by déedes or workes: in aſking what thing he ſhould do. Wherefore what directer aunſwer could be geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, then that which Chriſt vſed, ſéeing the queſtion was one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of woorkes? namely, kéepe the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundementes: ſéeing no other works <note place="margin">Chriſtes aunſwer to the lawiers queſtion</note> could ſerue that turne. But peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſome of them will ſay, If Chriſt had not knowne him able to kéepe the commaundementes, hée ſurely woulde haue taught him the way poſſyble to him. Surely theſe be tender hartes, that will teach the holy ghoſt to bée pitifull: but Chriſt him ſelfe ſayde, he came not
<pb facs="tcp:8358:130"/>
to call the righteous, but ſinners to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentaunce, that is, hée came not to call ſuche fellowes as woulde iuſtifie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues: <note place="margin">Luk. 5.</note> but ſuch as would humble them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to hys iuſtyfication. Wherefore Chriſt (ſeing the filthy pride of his heart) euen in the due aunſwer of hys queſty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, offered hym the glaſſe of the Lawe, (whereof he bragged in hys heart) to ſee his owne filthineſſe therein: that by the fight thereof, he might haue trained him to haue framed a more humble queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, concerning the waye to heauen. But what aunſwer maketh he? goeth he not on in the iuſtification of himſelfe, in ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? <hi>Al this haue I kept from my youth vpward: what lack I yet?</hi> Then Chryſte to open to his eyes the packe of hys cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, applieth to his verie heart a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiue, to teache him that the law is ſpiry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, and challengeth the entire obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the heart. <hi>If thou wilt be perfect</hi> (ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth he) <hi>ſell that thou haſt, and geue it to</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">This is a hard ſpeeche to the lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers of the worlde.</note> 
                  <hi>the poore, &amp; thou shalt haue treaſure in heauen, and come and follow me: which when hee hearde, hee went hys waye mourning, becauſe hee had great poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions.</hi>
                  <pb n="115" facs="tcp:8358:130"/>
So that it appereth by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole courſe of the action, that Chriſt enabled him not to the ſatiſfying of the lawe: but contrariwiſe (by example of hys owne wickednes compared with the lawe) he ſought to teache him, beyng a teacher of others, how farre he him ſelfe was ſhort from the vnderſtandyng of the Lawe, in ſuppoſing it to conſiſt onely in outwarde action. And to conclude, Chriſt offered the law to this proude ruler, to no other ende, then before generally it was gée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to all the Iewes, namely to ſée hys owne filthineſſe, thereby to be driuen to ſeeke reliefe in Chriſte: and it was alſo the very direct aunſwer to hys queſty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Other of the aduerſaryes cauyll thus: In déed (ſay they) there bee two iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifications, the one in regeneration or <note place="margin">An other argument of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtes.</note> baptiſme, and that is fréelye beſtowed vpon vs, neyther is it needefull that any good woorkes ſhoulde goe before this iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification.

The error and impietie of this doctryne
<pb facs="tcp:8358:131"/>
is not onely manifeſt (by that whiche is ſayd before) where it is proued that no workes, but onely the woorkes of the iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified by fayth, can appeare in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God: but alſo for that it fayneth Chriſt in reſpect of diuers tymes, to bée a mediator of diuers power, or abilitie.

Another <note place="margin">An other obiection.</note> of the ſhiftes, which theſe buſie hunters to robbe God of his honoure haue found out, is this: fayth (ſay they) doth iuſtifye: but fayth is a worke: therefore woorkes do iuſtifye. To whome wee aunſwere, <note place="margin">The aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere.</note> that faith in reſpect that it is our worke expreſſed by our will, or vnderſtanding, iuſtifyeth not: becauſe it is feeble and weake, for no man beléeueth ſo aſſured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as hee is bounde: nor doth ſo earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſſent vnto the truth of Gods promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes as he ought to do. Wherefore, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer fayth is ſayde to iuſtifye: fayth is there taken for the obiecte of faythe: Namely, for Chriſt, and the mercye of God in the promiſe. And for aſmuche as it is the inſtrument which taketh holde thereof: therefore is iuſtifycation impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto it: According to Saynt Paules ſayinge, <hi>Abraham beleeued God, and</hi>

Wherefore examining thys argument

of the aduerſaries: you ſhall ſée how finely at the firſt, they foiſt in a fallax, called of the logitians <hi>fallacia accidentis</hi> That is, <hi>the deceipt of the accident.</hi> Inferring that in the concluſion, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto that worde (whereuppon it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred) did not ſtretch it ſelfe, in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond propoſition, for where it is ſayde faith is a worke, to be a worke of ours, is but an accident vnto faith, in reſpect of iuſtification: for iuſtification com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth not, becauſe fayth is a worke of ours, but becauſe the mercie of God, doth in the promiſe fréely geue it, to al beleuers: So that faith in the firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition is referred, and hath relation, vnto the obiect of faith: namely, Chriſt, and the mercy of God, in the promiſe. And in the ſecond propoſition, fayth is there otherwiſe taken, namely, as it is a worke of ours. Wherefore, fayth not béeing one in bothe propoſitions, the concluſion is falſelye inferred. Or more briefely, it is aunſwered thus: Faith in the firſte propoſition is a rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue, in the predicament of relation, as in the 8. chapter is declared, and in the ſeconde propoſition: where it is conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:8358:133"/>
as a worke it falleth in the predica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of qualitie: wherby the argument hauing fower termes, the concluſion muſt needes bée falſe. An other of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries <note place="margin">1. Cor. 13.</note> argumentes is thys, Saint Paule affirmeth that of fayth, hope, and <note place="margin">Fayth, hope, and loue. Obiection</note> loue, loue is the greateſt, or moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent: and in that the fulfillyng of the lawe conſiſteth: and therefore iuſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is rather to be imputed to the more excellent: then to the inferior. That loue is moſt excellent of the three, it <note place="margin">Aunſwere.</note> is euydent: for fayth and hope haue on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly continuaunce, vntill the thinges that bée beléeued, and hoped for, bée fully in mannes poſſeſſyon. At whyche tyme they both ſhall ende: but loue doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue and floriſhe through all eternity, and that it is the fulfilling of the law, is in the. 4. chapter euydent. For who ſo loued God, and his neighbour, ſo muche <note place="margin">Loue ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filleth the law.</note> as he ought to doe, ſhoulde ſurely fulfill the lawe. But now touching their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, that becauſe it is more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, therfore it muſt iuſtify: that is more then childiſhe. The eare is a farre more excellent inſtrument, or organ of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye,

then is eyther the hand or mouth, for thereby we receaue the glad promy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of God, touchyng our whole felycy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: Shoulde wee therefore inferre, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the eare is the more excellent Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan or inſtrument, that therefore we ſhoulde receaue oure meate wyth oure eares, and not rather with the hand and <note place="margin">Fayth is the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue our iuſtification by Chriſt.</note> mouth? whiche though they be meaner, yet are they inſtrumentes appoynted to that vſe: And ſo fayth, though it bee the meaner, yet is it the inſtrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to that vſe.

or fruit of the righteouſnes of the ſame fayth. Therfore iuſtification is to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to that which apprehended the righteouſnes, and not to the fruit there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. Secondly and principally, that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as the end of all Gods works is to purchaſe to hym ſelfe (as of right is due) all prayſe, honour, and glory in the performance of his promiſe (as hath often bene ſayd) as the greateſt prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiue he challengeth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his creatures.
